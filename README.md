##### Welcome to my simple To-Do List task manager. At Northeastern's Code 4 Community club React Workshop, I developed this web application using the following technologies: HTML, CSS, and React JS. However, I further improved upon the fundamental structure of the project and implemented a responsive design with more application utility. During this workshop, I learned many React JS skills such as effectively using components, props, and hooks to design a fast web application with proper state management. Feel free to try it out! #####
